# Web_APIs-Code_Quiz

## Description

This project was designed to prepare me for the interview process, which often includes a coding assessment combining multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. To gain familiarity with these types of assessments and apply my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created a coding quiz. The quiz is initiated by clicking the start button and presents questions to the user. The quiz is timed, deducting time for each incorrect answer. At the end of the quiz, the user can view their score and retake the quiz as many times as desired.


During the project, I learned how to create and link multiple HTML pages and CSS style sheets within a single repository. I also discovered how to use a single set of JavaScript code for both HTML pages, improving the efficiency and maintainability of the code.
